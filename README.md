# Front End Filter Optimization

## Overview

This project is a frontend-driven business intelligence dashboard that mimics Amazon-style dynamic filtering. It allows users to filter a dataset by multiple criteria, with each filter updating intelligently based on selections made in other filters. The UI includes a paginated and scrollable table, interactive dropdowns, and efficient filtering logic.

## Features

-**Modulo-based Filtering**: Dataset columns represent modulo values (e.g., `mod3`, `mod4`, `mod5`, etc.)
-**Dynamic Filter Updates**: Selecting a value in one filter updates all others based on filtered data overlap
-**Paginated Table**: Displays 100 rows per page with only 20 visible at a time via scroll
-**Multi-Select Dropdowns**: Each filter supports searchable, multi-select dropdowns
-**High Performance**: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently with real-time updates

## How It Works

- Filters are generated from unique values of each column.
- When a filter is applied, the data is filtered first, and the remaining filters are updated to reflect only applicable values.
- This avoids the problem of selecting filters that lead to an empty dataset.

Example:
> Selecting `mod3 = 2` will automatically update `mod6` filter to only show values that overlap with those rows (e.g., only values like 1 or 3).

## Extra Functionalities

-A feature that will help us to upload csv's on spot for accurate and quick testing
